* Version 2.1.1.1, December 4, 2013

New in this version:

- The system defined "wanted packages" as packages in the *distribution*
  plus/minus the packages that were explicitly added or removed through the
  admin interface. This means that packages that were installed manually or
  through a script on the individual computer would be removed because they
  were neither in the distribution nor in the add list, and packages in the
  distribution that were removed on the individual computer would be added.

  Since the gateway needs a number of packages that were not added through the
  admin interface, this means it was basically nuked as soon as the
  synchronization started working, as we've seen with ticket #9383.

  From now on, the system will define "wanted packages" as *all packages
  currently present on the machine* plus all packages explicitly added in the
  admin system, minus all packages explicitly removed through the admin system.

  This creates a new problem, namely that packages which were added (or removed)
  through a group will no longer be automatically removed (or added,
  respectively) when a computer is removed from the group. That should probably
  be dealt with by a special field which specifies whether a package was added
  through group membership and should be removed if it's no longer demanded by
  any group. This is a task for a future version of the system.

* Version 2.1.0, October 11, 2013

New in this version:

A lot of bugs have been fixed, and the design has been thoroughly

- "System" site is added to host system scripts.
- Scripts to install LibreOffice 4 and Oracle's Java are added.
- The documentation has been finished.
- Technical documentation in source code is included on the admin site as
  well.
- Localization infrastructure is introduced to permit translation (currently
  Danish is only supported locale).
- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license has been added for
  the documentation.
- bibos-client has been changed to support wireless networks.
