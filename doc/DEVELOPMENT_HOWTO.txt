This document describes how to get the admin site up and running for
development purposes, i.e. with no Apache or proxy setup.

You should normally be able to do this in 10 minutes or less.


PRE-REQUISITES
++++++++++++++

Python 2.7
SQLite 3
python-virtualenv

Get them with apt-get install or by whatever means necessary for your
platform.


GRAB THE CODE
+++++++++++++

git clone https://github.com/magenta-aps/bibos_admin.git


GET THE RIGHT BRANCH
++++++++++++++++++++

cd bibos_admin
git checkout <development>

This only applies if you're not working directly on the master branch
(which you probably shouldn't). For <development> substitute the branch
you want to work on.


INSTALL DJANGO AND OTHER COMPONENTS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

cd admin_site

scripts/install.sh

This requires an Internet connection. It should run its course with a
number of warnings but no errors.


SOFT-LINK THE SETTINGS FILE
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

pushd bibos_admin/
ln -s settings_development.py settings.py
popd

This gives you the development settings. Most importantly, this features
an SQLite database.


RUN THE TEST SUITE
++++++++++++++++++

source bin/virtualenv  # To set up paths for Django etc.

python manage.py test

This is mainly a sanity check. The test should always pass.


CREATE THE DATABASE
+++++++++++++++++++

python manage.py syncdb

Answer "yes" when prompted to create a superuser and enter details.


RUN THE SERVER
++++++++++++++

python manage.py runserver 8080

"8080" is just an example, you can run it on whatever port you prefer.


PATCH THE USER
++++++++++++++

Log on to the admin site's user section:

http://localhost:8080/admin/auth/user/

Edit the user you just created. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and
choose "Super admin" as the user profile type.



ENJOY
+++++

Go to http://localhost:8080 to start using the system - create sites,
create groups, etc.

NOTE: The system was written in Django and consists of a Django site
with three apps: "account", "system" and "job". Most of the actual
functionality is concentrated in the "system"  app. Some knowledge of
Django is required to understand how the system is designed. Refer to
the graphical object model (BibOS.dia) for an explanation of the site's
object structure.


CLIENT STUFF
++++++++++++

You can make a source distribution for the bibos_client package located
in the root of the bibos_admin source tree. This is what you should use
to register new computers in the admin system. See the HOWTO on
attaching clients for further information.
