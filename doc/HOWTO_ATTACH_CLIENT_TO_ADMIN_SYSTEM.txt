PREPARE THE ADMIN SYSTEM
========================


Create distribution
+++++++++++++++++++

You need to create a "distribution" in the BibOS Admin system.  This is
done in django-admin.  

The distribution ID needs to be a string with no spaces and preferrably
no special characters. It should reflect the operating system on the
corresponding clients, e.g. "ubuntu12.04".


Create Site 
+++++++++++

You need to create a "site" to which you can attach your client. The
name of the site should describe your location, and the ID should be a
simple, lowercase string with no spaces or special characters, e.g.
"aarhus".


Finalize the distribution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This step is to be performed *after* you have registred a computer in the
admin system as described below. To finalize the distribution:

* Create a completely vanilla installation of the operating system you
  wish to define your "distribution", maybe with some additional
  packages which you wish to install on all your computers.

* Register the computer in the admin system as described below.

* When the registration is done, execute the command 

    bibos_upload_dist_packages

  in a command shell. This will upload the list of installed packages
  and register them as definition of this distribution.

* IMPORTANT: In the admin system's Django settings file, (e.g. in
  admin_system/bibos_admin/settings.py in the installed source code)
  close your distribution by adding its ID to the list
  CLOSED_DISTRIBUTIONS. 


REGISTER A CLIENT COMPUTER
==========================


Install bibos-client package
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, you need to install the BibOS Admin client on the PC you wish to
control from the admin system.

We recommend that you install this from PyPI using pip.

Enter the following commands in a bash shell:

    # If not installed already
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get install python-dev

    # This is what we want:
    sudo pip install bibos-client


After succesfully installing bibos-client, run the registration script
in order to connect with the admin system.

    sudo register_new_bibos_client.sh


Guide to the steps:

# Do not enter a gateway IP unless you *know* you will be using a gateway.
# Enter a new host name for your computer if you want. If not, your PC
  will be registered with its current name.
# Enter the ID for the site you wish to register the PC on (e.g.
  "aarhus").
# Enter the ID for the distribution (e.g. "ubuntu12.04").
# Enter the URL of your admin system (e.g. "http://localhost:8000" if
  you're a developer or "http://yourdomain.com/your_admin_dir".

The registration will now proceed, and your new PC will show up in the
admin system as "New" in the corresponding site's status list.

In order to start running scripts etc. on the computer, you need to
manually approve it's registration by "activating" it in the admin
system. View the details on the new computer and check the box marked
"Aktiv" or "Active". The PC will now start uploading its package info
and is under the control of the admin system.
